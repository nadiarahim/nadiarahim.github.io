        Project one is about the intersection of fashion and the labor that goes into making the clothing. Often people do not see or know where their clothes come from and the effort that goes into making them. However as someone that wishes to one day work in the fashion publication industry and has familial ties to the country of origin in which these garments are made, it puts me in the intersection of these two zones. Through the use of typography and sound I wish to show the conflicts of the two ends. I plan on using After Effects to create my work. I will be using audio from real garment workers on top of my type.
