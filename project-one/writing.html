        Project one is about the intersection of fashion and the labor that goes into making the clothing. 
        Often people do not see or know where their clothes come from and the efforts / struggles that goes into making them. However, as someone that wishes to one day work in the fashion publication industry and has familial ties to the country of origin in which these garments are made, it puts me in the intersection of these two zones. Through the use of type, visuals and audio I wish to show the conflicts of the two ends. I will be focusing on the Rana Plaza garment factory collapse as it is the deadliest accident in the history of the garment industry. I'll be using audio from high fashion runway shows to push that contrast even more.

        time square billboard  
        <ul>
          <li>
            this billboard will be outside of the h&m in time square. no one can touch the screen because it is so high but everyone will be able to see it. The sound is aubidle but faint due to all the noise form the city.

            this will be shown on a tv screen as a commerical on a news or educational channel. The audio is clear because it would be the only thing showing on the screen.
