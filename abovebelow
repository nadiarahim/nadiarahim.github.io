		<h1>How is looking <br> at something <br>like the earth <br>from above <br>a fantasy?</h1>
			<p class="response1">Looking at something like the earth <br>from above is something so little people can do. <br>It is an experience that not many can encounter. <br>Looking at earth from above is an unthinkable idea <br>and unlike anything else therefore it seems like a fantasy to most.
